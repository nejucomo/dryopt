Goals for release 0.1:

* Support for only Python 2.

* Running "./setup.py test" will run all of these tests:
  - pyflakes.
  - all unittests with branch coverage analysis.
  - all docstring examples as doctests.

* Basic API with subcommands which delegates as much as possible to
  argparse without compromising the API quality.

* Full unittest branch coverage.



Goals to investigate for future releases:

* A single codebase that can support Python 2 and 3.

* The potential for using Python 3 annotations to define options, along these lines:

  >>> from dryopt import Command, Option
  >>> @Command
  ... def greet(name : Option(help='The name to greet.'), title : Option(help='The title.') = 'Ms.'):
  ...     """Greet name with title."""
  ...     print 'Hello, ' + title + ' ' + name
  ...
  >>> greet('Ada')
  Hello, Ms. Ada
